# Description

In the lab today we had to use the 'done' argument and callback function in jest to get it to work properly.  When jest is testing asynchronous JavaScript code, it needs to know to wait for a test to complete before moving on to another test.  You pass the test the argument 'done' and then call the done() function at the bottom of the test to let jest know that it  can move on.  If the done() function doesn't get called, the test will fail as well.
