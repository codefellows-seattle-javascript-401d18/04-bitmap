# Using the App

To begin using the app you must first:

  1. You must save a 32-bitmap image in the assets folder.
  2. You must rename that image to bitmap.bmp.
  3. Open your terminal. Then locate and enter your project file.
  4. Run the following command in terminal:
    node index.js.

At this point you should find the additional .bmp files in your assets folder for copying and transfer for whatever project you need it for.
