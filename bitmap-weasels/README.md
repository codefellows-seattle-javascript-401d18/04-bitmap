## What is Bitmap?

Bitmap is a BMP image file manipulator written in JS using Node JS.  At this time, Bitmap tranforms the included BMP image (palette-bitmap.bmp) using three built filters.  The three tranforming filters included are gray, invert, and black. Gray tranforms the image to gray scale. Inverts the colors of the image.  Black blacks out the image.  The new files are then stored as separate images in the same asset folder as the provided image.
