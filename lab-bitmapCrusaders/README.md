## Project Description
Using JavaScript and Node.js, this program converts 32-bit bitmap images to greyscale, blackout (all black pixels), and inverted colors. :art: Using our code as a base, you can also create your own image conversions or custom filters by adjusting our transform.js file.

## Features:

## Installation
`npm something or other guys we need to fill this in`

## Usage
Our program automatically creates three converted images for you, which are written into the assets file.

1. Save a 32-bitmap image to the assets folder, with the name palette-bitmap.bmp - this is the image you want to convert.
2. With Node.js installed, run in terminal:

`node index.js`

3. Converted images (greyscale, blackout, and inverted colors) are written to /assets. Enjoy!
